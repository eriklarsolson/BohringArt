### Project Description
BohringArt is an interactive online exhibit for the "Future Present" gallery from a collaboration between the Science Gallery Of Detroit & Michigan State University. 

### Exhibit Description
"In this collaborative project, we propose to design an educational kiosk, using the principles of interactive design, that will convey physics concepts effectively to college students. The concepts are chosen from Introductory Physics courses. Depending on the number of students and mediators we hire, we will expand on the scientific visualization. We will recruit at least two undergraduate physics students, two undergraduate graphic designers, and two programmers from computer science & Engineering. The physics students (with Denaâ€™s supervision) will be responsible for communicating selected physics concepts to the designers. The designers will then use their knowledge to create infographics that elucidate physics phenomena."
