## Project Description
BohringArt is an interactive online exhibit for the "Future Present" gallery from a collaboration between the Science Gallery Of Detroit & Michigan State University. 

## Exhibit Description
"In this collaborative project, we propose to design an educational kiosk, using the principles of interactive design, that will convey physics concepts effectively to college students. The concepts are chosen from Introductory Physics courses. Depending on the number of students and mediators we hire, we will expand on the scientific visualization. We will recruit at least two undergraduate physics students, two undergraduate graphic designers, and two programmers from computer science & Engineering. The physics students (with Dena’s supervision) will be responsible for communicating selected physics concepts to the designers. The designers will then use their knowledge to create infographics that elucidate physics phenomena."

## Activites
### Laser and Lenses
Learn how lenses manipulate light to understand how your telescope sees distant stars. Experiment with the variables that affect the image formed when shining light through a lens, and begin controlling the type of image you see by manipulating these variables.

### Circuit Construction
Learn about circuit components to build one that can power your satellite. Demonstrate the flow of electrons in a circuit and how circuit components (capacitors, resistors, inductors, etc.) can affect their energy.

### To The Stars
Create a rocket consisting of an engine, boosters, a body, and a cone. Make sure to account for fuel, air resistance, and weight as all affect the rocket’s motion greatly! Send your rocket off into space with the telescope as the payload and along the way, answer TEXT-based questions that determine the fate of your journey!

### Stellar Life Cycle
Learn more about what your telescope sees, and a star’s life cycle from creation to destruction. See how important certain variables such as mass and radius are in determining the next phase and the stellar event, i.e. a supernova.
